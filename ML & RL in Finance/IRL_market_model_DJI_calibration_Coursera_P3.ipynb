    "## Econometric estimation of an IRL-based market portfolio model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your final course project on RL in Finance. In this project you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore and estimate an IRL-based model of market returns that is based on IRL of a market-optimal portfolio \n",
    "- Investigate the role and impact of choices of different signals on model estimation and trading strategies\n",
    "- Compare simple IRL-based and UL-based trading strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions for project structure and grading principles :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a project that will be graded based on a peer-to-peer review. The project consists of four parts. The maximum score for each part is 10, so that maximum score you can give your peers (and they can give you) is 40. The parts are as follows (more detailed instructions are in specific cells below):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 1**: Complete the model estimation for the DJI portfolio of 30 stocks, and simple signals such as simple moving averages constructed below (Max 10 point).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 2**: Propose other signals and investigate the dynamics for market caps obtained with alternative signals. Present your conclusions and observations. (Max 10 point).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 3**: Can you repeat your analysis for the S&P portfolio? You will have to build a data file, build signals, and repeat the model estimation process with your new dataset (Max 10 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 4** : Show me something else. This part is optional. Come up with your own idea of an interesting analysis. For example, you can build a strategy using an optimal market-implied policy estimated from this model, and compare it with PCA and absorption ratio strategies that we built in Course 2. (Max 10 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions for formatting your notebook and packages use can use **\n",

    "- Use one or more cells of the notebook for each section of the project. Each section is marked by a header cell below. Insert your cells between them without changing the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of an optimal presentation of your results and conclusions. Think of how hard or easy it will be for your fellow students to follow your logic and presentation. When you are grading others, you can add or subtract point for the quality of presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3 in this project. Using TensorFlow is encouraged but is not strictly necessary, you can use optimization algorithms available in scipy or scikit-learn packages. If you use any non-standard packages, you should state all neccessary additional imports (or instructions how to install any additional modules you use in a top cell of your notebook. If you create a new portfolio for parts 3 and 4 in the project, make your code for creating your dataset replicable as well, so that your grader can reproduce your code locally on his/her machine.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try to write a clean code that can be followed by your peer reviewer. When you are the reviewer, you can add or subtract point for the quality of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing this project you will:**\n",
    "- Get experience with building and estimation of your first IRL based model of market dynamics, and learn how this IRL approach extends the famous Black-Litterman model (see F. Black and R. Litterman, \"Global Portfolio Optimization\", Financial Analyst Journal, Sept-Oct. 1992, 28-43, and  D. Bertsimas, V. Gupta, and I.Ch.

    "In Week 4 lectures of our course we found that optimal investment policy in the problem of inverse portfolio optimization is a Gaussian policy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\pi_{\\theta}({\\bf a}_t |{\\bf y}_t ) =   \\mathcal{N}\\left({\\bf a}_t | \\bf{A}_0 + \\bf{A}_1 {\\bf y}_t, \\Sigma_p \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $ {\\bf y}_t $ is a vector of dollar position in the portfolio, and $ \\bf{A}_0 $, $ \\bf{A}_1 $ and $ \\Sigma_p $ are parameters defining a Gaussian policy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We said in the lecture that such Gaussian policy is found for both cases of a single investor and a market portfolio. We also sketched a numerical scheme that can iteratively compute coefficients $ \\bf{A}_0$, $ \\bf{A}_1 $ and $ \\Sigma_p $ using a combination of a RL algorithm called G-learning and a trajectory optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will explore implications and estimation of this IRL-based model for the most interesting case - the market portfolio. It turns out that for this case, the model can be estimated in an easier way using a conventional Maximum Likelihood approach. To this end, we will re-formulate the model for this particular case in three easy steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for a vector of $ N $ stocks, we introduced a size $ 2 N $-action vector \n",
    "$ {\\bf a}_t = [{\\bf u}_t^{(+)}, {\\bf u}_t^{(-)}] $, so that an action $ {\\bf u}_t $ was defined as a difference of two non-negative numbers \n",

    "This is the only result that we will use in order to construct a simple dynamic market model resulting from our IRL model. We use a deterministic limit of this equation, where in addition we set $ \\bf{U}_0 = \\bf{U}_1^{(z)} = 0 $, and replace $ \\bf{U}_1^{(x)} \\rightarrow \\phi $ to simplify the notation.

    "St. Andrews Economics Preprints}, 2007). We have found that such dynamics (in a multi-variate setting) can also be obtained for market caps (or equivalently for stock prices, so long as the number of shares is held fixed) using Inverse Reinforcement Learning! \n",
